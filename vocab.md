### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

### Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)

### Convolution
The idea is similar to the algorithms that look at small-scale features in images first (edges and textures, for example)m, then szoom out to look at the big picture. (Shane, pg. 52)

### Deepfakes
[Allowing] people to swap one person's head and/or body for another, even in video. (Shane, pg. 35)

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
It also had a tiny bit of long-term memory where it could keep track of information for longer than that sixty five-character window, but that amount of memory was too tiny to store an entire ingredient list. In machine learning terms, that makes this algorithm a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network rather than a plan RNN. (Shane, pg. 51)

### Machine Learning
[A] machine learning algorithm figures out the rules for itself via trial and error, gauging its success on goals the programmer has specified. As the AI tries to reach this goal, it can discover rules and correlations that the programmer didn't even know existed. (Shane, pg. 9)

### Pseudo-AI
An approach wherein programs start out as AI-powered but switch control over to humans if things get tough. (Shane, pg. 20)

### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Many text-enerating AIs can only keep track of a few workds at a time. (Shane, pg. 50)

### Rules-based learning
You create a list of commands, or rules, in a language the computer can understand, and the computer does exactly what you say. To solve a problem with a rules-based program, you have to know every step required to complete the program's task and how to describe each one of those steps. (Shane, pg. 9)

### Transfer Learning
[Starting] with an AI that's already partway to it's goal. (Shane, pg. 47)
