### üêç Python Fundamentals: Getting Started

- [ ] **Hello, world!**  
  - Open a Python REPL or Jupyter notebook and run:  
    ```python
    print("Hello, world!")
    ```

- [ ] **Variables and Printing**  
  - Assign `x = 5`, then `print(x)`.  
  - Create two more variables: a float (e.g., `pi = 3.14`) and a string (e.g., `greeting = "Hi"`), then print each with descriptive text.

- [ ] **Simple Arithmetic**  
  - Perform an operation: `y = x + 3`, then `print("x + 3 =", y)`.

- [ ] **User Input**  
  - Write a script that asks the user for their name and greets them:  
    ```python
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    ```  
  - Run it and capture a sample session.

- [ ] **Save Your Work**  
  - Put all these commands into a single `exercise_1.py` file or notebook.
