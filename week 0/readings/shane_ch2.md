# Chapter 2 – “AI is everywhere, but where is it exactly?”

- [ ] **Domain Survey:** List five application domains Shane highlights. For each:
  - Describe in 1–2 sentences how AI is used in that domain.
  - Note one technical or human challenge it faces.
- [ ] **Missing Domain:** Identify one field you believe AI could transform that Shane doesn’t mention.  
  - Outline a brief use-case scenario.
- [ ] **Cross-Domain Insight:** In 2–3 sentences, describe a pattern or principle that appears across multiple domains (e.g., data needs, transparency concerns).
