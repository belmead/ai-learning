# Chapter 2 – “AI is everywhere, but where is it exactly?”

- [ ] **Domain Survey:** List five application domains Shane highlights. For each:
  - Describe in 1–2 sentences how AI is used in that domain.
  - Note one technical or human challenge it faces.
for all the sunshine listed, Shane notes the common thread is high-volume, repetitive tasks, even if the human would be better at them.
1) recommendations: algorithms, like those found in YouTube and Instagram, predict what a user may want to watch based on previous information. 
2) astrology: analyzing billions of photos of the heavens to locate examples of gravitational lensing would take humans ages, while AI can do it comparatively quickly. despite producing false positives, it does a fine job of wedding out 90% of the truly false images.
3) article composition: reporting on largely data-driven articles, such as real estate listings, is a task AI excels at, since little to no creativity is required to produce a quality listing.
4 medicine:
- [ ] **Missing Domain:** Identify one field you believe AI could transform that Shane doesn’t mention.
  - Outline a brief use-case scenario.
- [ ] **Cross-Domain Insight:** In 2–3 sentences, describe a pattern or principle that appears across multiple domains (e.g., data needs, transparency concerns).
