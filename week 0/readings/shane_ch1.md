# Chapter 1 – “What is AI?”

- [ ] **Definitions:** Identify the three working definitions Shane provides for “AI.” For each:
  - Write 2–3 sentences comparing it to classical “if–then” programs.
  - Note what “intelligence” adds under that definition.
- [ ] **Core Concept:** Summarize one fundamental idea from the chapter (e.g., pattern recognition, trial-and-error learning) and cite a modern system that exemplifies it.
- [ ] **Ethical/Societal Reflection:** Reflect in 2–3 sentences on one implication Shane raises about how that form of AI interacts with people or society.
