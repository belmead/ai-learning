# Chapter 1 – “What is AI?”

- [ ] **Definitions:** Identify the three working definitions Shane provides for “AI.” For each:
  - Write 2–3 sentences comparing it to classical “if–then” programs.
  - Note what “intelligence” adds under that definition.
- [ ] **Core Concept:** Summarize one fundamental idea from the chapter (e.g., pattern recognition, trial-and-error learning) and cite a modern system that exemplifies it.
trial-and-error learning is an aspect of machine learning wherein a system learns the rules of a system by repeatedly trying and failing until it meets goals set forth by the programmer. an example of this is image recognition. 
trial-and-error is in contrast to rules-based systems, where the computer followed guidelines exactly as the programmer declares them. this is also known as GOFAI, or symbolic AI. an example of this is a medical decision tree for determining diagnoses.
- [ ] **Ethical/Societal Reflection:** Reflect in 2–3 sentences on one implication Shane raises about how that form of AI interacts with people or society.
one of Shane's four signs of ai doom is, "the ai tried to learn from flawed data." in the scenario where an AI was tasked with screening job candidates, were the ai trained on biased data, it would produce biased results. instead of screening for the "best" candidates, it screens for the characteristics the data showed was "best," despite "best" being initially chosen by those who hired, which in turn was a reflection of their biases.
