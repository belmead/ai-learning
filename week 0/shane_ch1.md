# Ch 1 – “What is AI?”

    Definitions: List three working definitions Shane gives for “AI.” For each, write 2–3 sentences on how that framing could inform a finance-app design.

    Real-world example: Find a 2025 AI system that fits one of those definitions. Bullet one benefit and one risk in a financial context.

# Ch 2 – “AI is everywhere, but where is it exactly?”

    Domain mapping: List five application domains Shane cites. For two of them, write a 1-sentence note on how you might prototype that domain in your department.

    Surprise domain: Name one domain Shane omits but you think is ripe for finance (e.g. credit-fraud pattern detection); bullet a simple prototype idea.
